- Hints: Learn about list methods (append, remove, etc.) and array operations.

#### Day 2: Dictionaries
- Task: Create a program that uses dictionaries to store and retrieve information.
- Hints: Understand dictionary key-value pairs and explore dictionary methods.

#### Day 3: Tuples and Sets
- Task: Write a script that demonstrates the use of tuples and sets.
- Hints: Explore tuple and set operations and their immutability/mutability.

#### Day 4: Linked Lists
- Task: Implement a simple linked list and perform basic operations.
- Hints: Understand node structures and linked list manipulation.

#### Day 5: Stacks and Queues

- Task: Define and use database models in SQLAlchemy.
- Hints: Understand how to structure and represent data in a database.

#### Day 13: Database Migrations
- Task: Perform database migrations using tools like Alembic.
- Hints: Learn about versioning and managing database schema changes.

### Week 4: Cloud Computing

#### Day 14: Introduction to Cloud Platforms
- Task: Sign up for a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud).
- Hints: Explore the cloud console and understand basic services.

#### Day 15: Cloud Storage
- Task: Use cloud storage to upload and retrieve files.
- Hints: Understand object storage and cloud storage APIs.

#### Day 16: Cloud Databases
- Task: Set up and configure a cloud database (e.g., AWS RDS).
- Hints: Explore database-as-a-service offerings.

#### Day 17: Deploying Python Applications to the Cloud
- Task: Deploy a simple Python app on a cloud platform.
